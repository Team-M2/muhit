## This application is a reference application prepared to introduce the use of Map Kit, Location Kit and Site Kit used for location based operations within the Huawei Mobile Services (HMS) ecosystem.


### Application Promotion

- When you open the application, you will see a full screen map. This map is provided with the Huawei Map Kit.
- If you grant location permission, Huawei Location Kit provides instant location information.
- Your obtained location information is sent to Huawei Site Kit to reach the closest POIs to your location. (POI: Point of Interest)
- You choose the type of POI you want to see from the drop-down box on the screen, and thanks to the data provided by Huawei Site Kit, the nearest POI list is created.
- The information in this list is processed and added to the Huawei Map as a marker (pin).
- For example, when you select ATM from the list, you can quickly see the ATMs closest to you on the map.


### Things to Know
